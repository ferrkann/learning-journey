# Learning Journey

A public log of my self-learning journey across engineering, energy, geoscience, and data—based on books, papers, courses, and videos.  
This repo is a documentation of how my understanding evolves over time.

**Quick TL;DR (ID):** Repo ini berisi catatan belajar, ringkasan konsep dengan bahasa sendiri, pertanyaan yang belum terjawab, dan mini-output (diagram, hitungan kecil, atau kode ringan).

---

## What you will find here

- **Learning logs**: short notes from each study session (what I learned, key idea, next question)
- **Topic pages**: curated summaries per topic (my best current understanding)
- **Mini outputs**: small calculations, diagrams, code snippets, or experiments
- **Resource trail**: references with links (and timestamps for videos)

> I prioritize clarity over completeness. If something is uncertain, I mark it as a question.

## Repository map

- `notes/`  
  Daily/weekly learning logs (chronological).  
- `topics/`  
  Topic-based pages that I update over time (the “clean” version).  
- `projects/`  
  Mini projects, simulations, notebooks, and experiments.  
- `assets/`  
  Images, diagrams, PDFs, and other supporting files.

## How I write notes (my format)

Each note usually includes:

- **What I learned (3 bullets)**
- **Core concept (in my own words)**
- **Mini application** (a small example: calc/diagram/pseudo-code)
- **Next question(s)**
- **Sources** (links + timestamps)

Language policy:
- Main explanations: **Indonesian** (faster & more natural for deep thinking)
- Technical terms + TL;DR + titles: **English** (aligned with common references)

## Start here

- Latest learning logs: see [`notes/`](./notes/)
- Topic index: see [`topics/`](./topics/)
- Mini outputs: see [`projects/`](./projects/)

If you’re new to this repo, a good entry point is the topic pages, then jump to the logs for the process.

## Topics (growing)

I currently explore topics like:
- Geothermal / subsurface / applied geoscience
- Data & modeling (stats, ML, numerical methods)

*(This list will keep changing as my interests evolve.)*

## Attribution & ethics

- I only include **my own summaries** and **original explanations**.
- For external resources (books, papers, videos), I provide references.
- If you find a mistake or unclear explanation, feel free to open an Issue.
